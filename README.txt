NOTES:
Here is the formula how the marks are calculated:

Overall-Mark-for-scheduler= Number of people + (seniority points X 2) + time - unused time


Ranges and info:
Number of people = 1 to 6
seniority points= 1 to 5
time = each 10 min is a +1 point and each 10 min unused is -1
Time range=from 1 minute to max of 3 hours
Arrival time = from 8 am to 16(4 pm)
Time slots = from 8 am to 19 (7 pm)
Can only scheduled at the beginning of an hour marks (we have 1 hour slots) 
 
You don't lose a mark if there is no team left to scheduled and you have some unused time
